/*
 * The Stability Pool holds LUSD tokens deposited by Stability Pool depositors.
 *
 * When a trove is liquidated, then depending on system conditions, some of its LUSD debt gets offset with
 * LUSD in the Stability Pool:  that is, the offset debt evaporates, and an equal amount of LUSD tokens in the Stability Pool is burned.
 *
 * Thus, a liquidation causes each depositor to receive a LUSD loss, in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.
 * They also receive an ETH gain, as the ETH collateral of the liquidated trove is distributed among Stability depositors,
 * in the same proportion.
 *
 * When a liquidation occurs, it depletes every deposit by the same fraction: for example, a liquidation that depletes 40%
 * of the total LUSD in the Stability Pool, depletes 40% of each deposit.
 *
 * A deposit that has experienced a series of liquidations is termed a "compounded deposit": each liquidation depletes the deposit,
 * multiplying it by some factor in range ]0,1[
 *
 * Please see the implementation spec in the proof document, which closely follows on from the compounded deposit / ETH gain derivations:
 * https://github.com/liquity/liquity/blob/master/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf
 *
 * --- LQTY ISSUANCE TO STABILITY POOL DEPOSITORS ---
 *
 * An LQTY issuance event occurs at every deposit operation, and every liquidation.
 *
 * Please see the system Readme for an overview:
 * https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/README.md#lqty-issuance-to-stability-providers
